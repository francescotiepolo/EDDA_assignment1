```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Read the data
setwd("~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UvA/CLS/Experimental Design and Data Analysis/Assignment 1/EDDA_assignment1")
data <- read.table("crops.txt", header=TRUE)
```

## Exercise 2

### a)

We first perform ANOVA only with County and Related.

```{r}
model = lm(Crops ~ County + Related, data=data); anova(model)
```

We follow by including the interaction between the two

```{r}
model_int = lm(Crops ~ County * Related, data=data); anova(model_int)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
